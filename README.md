## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!

You use this tool at your own risk. I do not give any quarantee about compatibility or security.

The Azure Web SQL tool should be completely removed from your public web server environment when you have finished with it to remove the risk of it being used to abuse your database (even if you have the security key configured).
